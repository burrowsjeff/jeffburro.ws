Two ways to do this: you handle the conversion, or you let GitHub do it.
7:42 The former is with pandoc and a script, the latter is to use something like Jekyll, which GitHub supports.
7:43 I prefer the former, because simplicity and flexibility.
7:43 e.g. (1) edit markdown (2) pandoc -f markdown -t html index.md -o index.html (3) commit and push
7:44 The nice thing is you can tell pandoc to include things in the header, like a title or a stylesheet, etc.
7:44 So all your source material is plain and simple markdown.
7:45 And if you need to make a slideshow: pandoc -f markdown -t slidy mypresentation.md -o mypresentation.html
7:45 Pandoc also handles latex, and a zillion other formats.

7:46 Awesome. So this is probably a dumb question:
7:47 If I reference a stylesheet in the header and then convert it to html with pandoc, does it reference that stylesheet? Or does it make those references absolute so the html becomes a standalone document?

earldouglas
7:47 You can do either.
7:48 Coincidentally, I just switched from one to the other a few minutes ago.
7:48 I was including /style.css in every page, but I decided it's lame to do a second http request.  So I switched to just include the css in the page itself.
7:48 You do it with: pandoc -H myheader.html

8:12 sudosandwiches: Note the first three lines that start with a percent symbol in the markdown file.

8:12 Pandoc uses these for title, author, and date, respectively.
8:12 You can omit them or leave them blank.
8:13 But the title one is nice, because it gets added to <head><title>

sudosandwiches
8:17 Okay, thanks.
8:17 Can pandoc output markdown to pdf?
8:17 (I'm wondering if I can use it for my resume as well)
earldouglas
8:18 Yes
8:18 You'll want a latex template for that.
8:18 And I don't know latex well engouh.

Looks like you need: (1) your resume.md file (2) this guy's style_whatever.tex template and (3) this command:
12:37 pandoc --standalone --template style_chmduquesne.tex \
12:37     --from markdown --to context \
12:37     -V papersize=A4 \
12:37     -o resume.tex resume.md; \
12:37     context resume.tex
12:37 Probably his css file too: style_chmduquesne.css

pandoc --standalone --template style_chmduquesne.tex --from markdown --to context -V papersize=A4 -o resume.tex resume.md; context resume.tex
