Dear search committee,


I am writing to apply for the Project Manager - Security position within Nintex. I have a strong background in technology, consulting, management, and finance. I have worked with dozens of tech companies across the US and I bring the following skills to this PM position:


* Internal and external auditing using primarily the SOC2 and ISO 27001 frameworks
* Project management and technical coordination
* Technical documentation creation and review
* Process mapping and improvement


My unique and diverse background make me a strong candidate for this position within Nintex and I look forward to hearing from you.

<br><br>

Sincerely,

<br>

 
Jeff Burrows
